[h1]Crusader Kings 3: Take Vows Character Interaction[/h1]

A very simple mod which adds an interaction to your children to make them take vows and become a monk.

This is useful for handling inheritance issues with partition. This is an alternative to disinheriting your child and spending renown.

It's important to note that forcing your child to take the vows is [b]a really bad thing[/b] to do in general. You won't spend renown, but they [b]will never have children of their own[/b]. If you are in the early game, it is probably better to spend the renown and disinherit. As you approach midgame, your dynasty should be large enough that the renown you spent will be largely meaningless. Disinherited children can have children of their own, and depending on whom you marry them to they can also become landed in other realms.

If you're in the early game, or you are a Count/Duke, and you're facing a split it is better to let your realm split and go to war to get it back. Disinheriting or forcing them to take the vows is useful for mid game where you're a King or Emperor or when your character has had 10 sons and you don't know what to do with the insane splitting.

In the current version of the game, the only way to make your child a monk is to forcefully imprison them (potentially using a hook in the process) and immediately release them forcing them to take vows. Not only does this not make much sense (as head of the family), but it likely makes you incur a massive tyranny penalty from all your vassals as you forcefully imprisoned someone for no reason (unless your child had already commited a crime which I do not think is possible.)

This mod adds an interaction when you right click on your child that allows you to make them take the vows.

The following conditions have to be met:
[list]
[*]The character must be your child.
[*]The character must be aged 15 or younger.
[*]The character cannot be married (but they can be betrothed).
[*]The character cannot be your heir.
[*]The character cannot already be a monk.
[/list]

They will always accept it, and you'll gain a small (50) amount of piety for promising
your child to the clergy. You will incur the games negative opinion penalty by forcing
someone to become a monk.

I'm open to suggestions if people think we could do more with it. At the moment it's
incredibly simple but if anyone has any suggestions feel free to post them!
