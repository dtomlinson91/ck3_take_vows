[h1]Crusader Kings 3: Take Vows Character Interaction[/h1]

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
[*]Force your own children (and children in your court) to become monks, removing them from their inheritence at the cost of not being able to marry and have children of their own.
[*]A unique nickname "the Reverential" if you give away 3 of your children to the church (for Christian faiths only).
[/list]

[h2]Description[/h2]

A simple mod which adds an interaction to your children (and any children in your court) to make them take vows and become a monk.

This is meant to be a RP friendly way for you to handle partition issues. You no longer have to murder your children, lock them up or disinherit them (and spend renown in the process).

Bear in mind that forcing your child to take the vows is [b]a really bad thing[/b] to do in general. You won't spend renown, but they [b]will never have children of their own[/b]. Whereas disinherited children can have children of their own, and depending on whom you marry them to they can also become landed in other realms (giving you renown later down the line).

In the current version of the game, the only way to make a child a monk is to forcefully imprison them and immediately release them forcing them to take vows. Not only does this not make much sense (as head of the family), but it likely makes you incur a massive tyranny penalty from all your vassals as you forcefully imprisoned someone for no reason.

This mod adds an interaction when you right click on the child that allows you to force them take the vows.

[b]The AI will never do this[/b] - this is only an option for the player. It is not Ironman compatible.

The following conditions have to be met:
[list]
[*]The character must be either your own child or in your court.
[*]The character must be aged 15 or younger.
[*]The character cannot be married (but they can be betrothed).
[*]The character cannot already be a monk.
[/list]

The child will always accept and you'll gain a small (50) amount of piety for promising
your child to the clergy. There's a small opinion loss with any children you force this on.

If you force your heir you will gain stress and an even larger opinion loss.

If your child is currently landed, it will depose them and you'll be granted all their lands and their titles.

I'm open to suggestions if people think we could do more with it. At the moment it's
fairly simple but if anyone has any suggestions feel free to post them!
